	abstract = {The oxidation of surrogate diesel fuels composed of mixtures of three pure hydrocarbons with and without their cetane numbers chemically enhanced using 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (2-EHN) is studied in a variable pressure flow reactor over a temperature range 500 - 900 K, at 12.5 atmospheres and a fixed reaction time of 1.8 sec. Changes in both low temperature, intermediate temperature, and hot ignition chemical kinetic behavior are noted with changes in the fuel cetane number. Differences appear in the product distribution and in heat release generated in the low and intermediate temperature regimes as cetane number is increased. A chemically enhanced cetane fuel shows nearly identical oxidation characteristics to those obtained using pure fuel blends to produce the enhanced cetane value. The decomposition chemistry of 2-EHN was also studied. Pyrolysis data of 10\% 2-EHN in -heptane and toluene are reported. Experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure in argon at temperatures from 400 - 850 and at 12.5 atm pressure in nitrogen at temperatures from 450 - 700 K. Based upon these measurements, a phenomenological mechanism for the initial steps of 2-EHN decomposition is proposed.},

@article{Splitter.2010,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT Heavy-duty engine experiments were conducted to explore reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion through addition of the cetane improver di-tertbutyl peroxide (DTBP) to pump gasoline. Unlike previous diesel/gasoline dual-fuel operation of RCCI combustion, the present study investigates the feasibility of using a single fuel stock (gasoline) as the basis for both high reactivity and low reactivity fuels. The strategy consisted of port fuel injection of gasoline and direct injection of the same gasoline doped with a small volume percent addition of DTBP. With 1.75\% DTBP by volume added to only the direct-injected fuel (which accounts for approximately 0.2\% of the total fueling) it was found that the additized gasoline behaved similarly to diesel fuel, allowing for efficient RCCI combustion. The single fuel results with DTBP were compared to previous high-thermal efficiency, low-emissions results with port injection of gasoline and direct injections of diesel. The comparison between fueling strategies found that the higher volatility of gasoline enabled a reduction in the direct injection pressure from 800 (bar) with diesel to 400 (bar) with gasoline. At the tested conditions, the peak gross indicated based thermal efficiency was over 57\%. The emissions trends and magnitudes of the single fuel strategy were also comparable to those of the diesel/gasoline dual-fuel strategy, and both engine-out NOx and PM met EPA HD 2010 emissions mandates without aftertreatment. Also, the decreased low temperature heat release with the single fuel strategy was found to lower compression work and increased thermal efficiency by approximately 1\% over the diesel/gasoline case. The results demonstrate that a very small percentage of an appropriate additive can be used to establish a sufficiency large reactivity gradient to match the performance of a dual fuel strategy when operated in the RCCI combustion regime.},

In this paper we propose that an innovative new class of heat transfer fluids can be engineered by suspending metallic nanoparticles in conventional heat transfer fluids. The resulting {open\_quotes}nanofluids{close\_quotes} are expected to exhibit high thermal conductivities compared to those of currently used heat transfer fluids, and they represent the best hope for enhancement of heat transfer. The results of a theoretical study of the thermal conductivity of nanofluids with copper nanophase materials are presented, the potential benefits of the fluids are estimated, and it is shown that one of the benefits of nanofluids will be dramatic reductions in heat exchanger pumping power.},

@article{Vijver.2020,
	abstract = {KinBot is a Python code that automatically characterizes kinetically important stationary points on reactive potential energy surfaces and arranges the results into a form that lends itself easily to master equation calculations. This version of KinBot tackles C, H, O and S atom containing species and unimolecular (isomerization or dissociation) reactions. KinBot iteratively changes the geometry of the reactant to obtain initial guesses for reactive saddle points defined by KinBot’s reaction types, which are then optimized by a third-party quantum chemistry package. KinBot verifies the connectivity of the saddle points with the reactant and identifies the products through intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. New calculations can be automatically spawned from the products to obtain complete potential energy surfaces. The utilities of KinBot include conformer searches, projected frequency and hindered rotor calculations, and the automatic determination of the rotational symmetry numbers. Input files for popular RRKM master equation codes are automatically built, enabling an automated workflow all the way to the calculation of pressure and temperature dependent rate coefficients. Four examples are included. (i) [1,3]-sigmatropic H-migration reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxygenates are calculated to assess the relative importance of suprafacial and antrafacial reactions. (ii) Saddle points on three products of gamma-valerolactone thermal decomposition are studied and compared to literature potential energy surfaces. (iii) The previously published propene+OH reaction is reproduced to show the capability of building an entire potential energy surface. (iv) All species up to C4 in the Aramco Mech 2.0 are subjected to a KinBot search.

Example runs including all input and output files for a one-well search for propanol radical, full PES search for the n-pentyl radical, a search for all homolytic scission in propanol, and the reaction searches for GVL (output.zip) 7. Results of symmetry calculations for a literature benchmark dataset (Symmetry\_correct.pdf, Symmetry\_wrong.pdf) Nature of problem: Automatic discovery of unimolecular reaction pathways (isomerization and dissociation) for molecules and radicals relevant in gas-phase combustion and atmospheric chemistry, including oxidation and pyrolytic processes for structures including carbon, oxygen, sulfur and hydrogen atoms. The reactants, products, and transition states are characterized using a suite of tools coupled to electronic structure codes, and the results are provided in a format that lends itself easily to calculating rate coefficients based on statistical rate theories with other external codes. Solution method: Reaction pathways are identified using heuristic searches starting from a reactant by iteratively altering its geometry toward a good guess for a transition state for reactions with barriers. The transition state is identified as a first-order saddle point on the potential energy surface, which is located using local optimization methods of third-party quantum chemistry codes. We use intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations to verify the direct connectivity of the saddle point to the reactant and to identify the product species. Conformational searches, hindered rotor potentials, frequency calculations, and high-level optimizations yield the necessary data for RRKM master equation calculations. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: KinBot is designed to run on Unix clusters, and is written in Python, compatible with versions 2.7 and 3. It communicates with a PBS or SLURM workload manager to submit quantum chemistry calculations to third-party software. It makes use of a modified fork of ASE for the input writing, calling and output parsing of the quantum chemistry software which has been tested with Gaussian (G09RevD.01). OpenBabel (2.4.1) and RDKit (2018.09.01) are used to convert smiles to internal species representations and for species comparison and results visualization. The output of KinBot can be visualized with the PESViewer script, and graph structures are drawn using NetworkX. The master equation solvers MESS or MESMER are needed to calculate rate coefficients at the end of a given run. This version of KinBot can handle H, C, S, and O atom-containing molecules, and searches for isomerization and dissociation pathways.},

@article{Miller.2021,
	abstract = {Over the last 20 to 25 years theoretical chemistry (particularly theoretical chemical kinetics) has played an increasingly important role in developing chemical kinetics models for combustion. Theoretical methods of obtaining rate parameters are now competitive in accuracy with experiment, particularly for small molecules. Moreover, theoretical methods can deal with conditions that experiments frequently cannot. In addition to increased accuracy, theory has rejuvenated methods and discovered phenomena that were completely unappreciated, or at least underappreciated, in the 20th century. Our primary interest here is in molecular-level issues, i.e. in calculating rate and transport parameters. However, dealing with kinetics models that involve thousands of reactions and hundreds of species is important for practical applications and is relatively new to the 21st century. Theory, in a general sense, and theoretical methods development have a role to play here too. We discuss in this review all these topics in some detail with an emphasis on issues and methods that have emerged in the last 20 years or so. Even so, our review is selective, rather than comprehensive, out of necessity.},
