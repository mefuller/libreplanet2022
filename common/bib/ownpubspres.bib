@phdthesis{Fuller.Thesis,
	abstract = {The development of fundamental chemical kinetic mechanisms and rates as relevant to nitrogenated
fuel additives requires both experimental and computational investigation. Experimental investiga-
tions may be carried out by the use of a shock tube, the history and theory of which are discussed.
A new shock tube facility has been designed and constructed at Brown University that is capable
of configuration for a multitude of diagnostics and wide range of experimental conditions. A full
description of the design and capabilities of this instrument is included as well as an overview of
the diagnostic capabilities with emphasis on the current implementation of laser-schlieren densito-
metry. Experimental investigations into both nitrite and nitrate compounds are discussed with an
emphasis on low-temperature combustion chemistry. In conjunction with the experimental inves-
tigations, modeling work is presented to assess the role of intermediates HONO and HNO2, which
are not readily accessible to experiments. Finally, some discussion of an effort to develop improved
methodologies for estimating collisional energy transfer parameters, a large source of uncertainty in
master equation system solutions, is presented.},
